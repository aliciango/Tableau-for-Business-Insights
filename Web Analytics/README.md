You can view the dashboard here: [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Tableauwebmarketingdashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

•	Key takeaway from dashboard: While engagement looks decent (avg. 98 seconds), the high load time and drop-off rates suggest friction in the customer journey.

1. Website Analytics Framework
•	I make this framework based on an article about web analytics ([Article](https://uxcam.com/blog/website-analytics-metrics/#:~:text=At%20their%20core%2C%20web%20analytics,help%20you%20spot%20friction%20points.)). Understanding the parallel processes of users and the layers of functions on our company's website is important. Using this framework, we can figure out the reasons that drive low conversion rate and understand our marketing activities, which happen before the customers access our website.

2. Connection Between Dashboard & Framework
•	Average Page Load Time (72s) links directly to speed issue → fix infrastructure.
•	High Exits & Bounce Rate tie to UX clarity & flow → users may be confused or disengaged.
•	Device category trends indicate mobile optimization is critical since engagement differs by device.
•	Average Pageviews (3) vs Unique Pageviews (2) suggests redundancy → users may reload or loop unnecessarily → poor navigation.

3. Limitations & Next Steps
•	Current dataset is synthetic, so results are hard to interpret. In the future, more context about customer behavior on the web should be collected.
•	For another project, I would dive deeper into some metrics on which this dataset lacks information to provide.
o	By traffic source (organic vs paid).
o	By customer type (new vs returning).
o	Funnel analysis (cart abandonment, checkout friction).
